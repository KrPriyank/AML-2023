Fraud detection is a crucial aspect of maintaining the security and stability of various systems and organizations. The problem of 
fraud can be framed as identifying instances of malicious or unauthorized activities that deviate from normal behavior. Fraudulent 
activities can take many forms such as credit card fraud, insurance fraud, and identity theft, among others. These activities can 
cause significant financial losses, damage the reputation of organizations, and erode public trust. The traditional methods of fraud 
detection, such as manual rule-based systems, are no longer effective due to the increasing complexity and volume of fraudulent 
activities. This is where Machine Learning (ML) comes in. ML algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns and 
anomalies that may be indicative of fraud. The ability of ML algorithms to learn from data and improve over time makes them well 
suited for fraud detection. The solution design for a fraud detection system involves collecting and cleaning data, selecting 
appropriate ML algorithms, training and validating the model, and finally deploying the model for real-time fraud detection. The 
system should be able to continuously monitor incoming data, generate alerts for suspicious activities, and update the model with new
 information to improve its accuracy over time.
